# HavenAR - Research, decisions and intial work

## Introduction

HavenAR is a place were you can immerse into an environment using only your phone and headphones. During busy days we do not have a lot of time for relaxation, so we stress out. HeavenAR aims to be an app where you can immerse in a calm environment projected on nearby table. This way you focus on the chosen by you environment and isolate the stress factor.

## Current progress

### Ideation

The final concept emerged after a long process of ideation. It all began with the idea of using AR to project an object. My first thought was to create a sorting app where AR could help users place trash into the correct bins. However, I realized that simpler non-XR solution already exist in Denmark, with packaging labels that clearly indicate the appropriate recycling bin.

From there, I considered developing an AR project using 3D models to enhance understanding, but I found that many such implementations already existed online, and even our teacher showed us student examples. Because of this, I set aside my ideas related to biology and the solar system.

Still, while brainstorming around the solar system, I imagined portals to different planets and began to wonder: where should a portal to Earth lead? At first, I pictured a bustling city like New York, but then I thought about my own preference—I would rather be in a calm, relaxing place.

That shift in perspective inspired my final idea: creating an AR experience that helps people immerse themselves in their favorite peaceful environment. A beach where you can hear waves splashing, a forest filled with birds and deer, or a campfire crackling in the night. A place to focus, recharge, and reduce stress.


### Unity choice

Although Unity 6 offers many benefits—such as improved performance with the GPU Resident Drawer, advanced rendering capabilities through RenderGraph for URP, Adaptive Probe Volumes for faster and higher-quality lighting, and enhanced AI and multiplayer tools—it was initially our preferred choice for the project. However, after testing our free assets, we found that support was limited. Numerous warnings appeared, and several shaders were incompatible with URP 17. Switching to Unity 2022.3 provided much better compatibility with these assets and significantly reduced the time required to fix issues, making development smoother and more efficient. While Unity 6 introduces exciting new technologies that could enhance future projects, for our current school project, Unity 2022.3 struck the best balance between stability and asset support.

## Use Cases
**Stressed worker:**

**Stressed student waiting for examination:**

You are a student who is infront of the examination room waiting for his turn. You are seeing all other students stressed about the exam reading through everything again and again. You have read everything and you know that you are prepared but still concerned that the examinor could ask something unexpected. You panic. Then in the panic you start scrolling through your phone. You see HeavenAR. You remembered that fellow student showed you this some months ago. You put your headphones on and start the app. You immerse into the small ocean that you put on the floor. You hear the waves splashing. You feel relaxed. Suddenly your name is said. You turn around and see the examinor asking for you with a smile. You enter the room and answer calmly the questions they ask you. They give you 12 because you were feeling calm and confident in what you know.
