# Course Introduction
Our first lecture provided a comprehensive introduction to the XDR1 course. We covered important for us things like exam requirements and learning objectives as well as some very interesting topics like history of (Augmented Reality) AR and (Virtual Reality) VR, benefits and capabilities of these technologies and some example projects from former students of the course as well as real life examples.
We were introduced to the XR lab where all sort of needed equipment can be found.

The **why** and **what** questions I will try to answer in this blog post were discussed extensivly in the class and now I will write a reflection on these 2 questions.
