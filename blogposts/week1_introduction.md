## Course Introduction
Our first lecture provided a comprehensive introduction to the XDR1 course. We covered important for us things like exam requirements and learning objectives as well as some very interesting topics like history of AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality), benefits and capabilities of these technologies and some example projects from former students of the course as well as real life examples.
We were introduced to the XR lab where all sort of needed equipment can be found.

The aim of this blog post is to further reflect on the **what** and **why** questions discussed in class. Exploring the ideas and motivation in XR technologies is the main driver.

## XR Terminology and Concept

eXtended Reality (XR) is the umbrella term which encapsulates all immersive technologies. There are two main types of XR technologies - VR and AR:

VR - system that presents a 3D generated computer environment that immerses a user by simulating this generated reality through a VR headset and other devices, allowing them to interact with the virtual world as if they were truly present in it.

AR - system that enriches the real world by placing virtual objects (images, text, 3D objects, etc) to enhance the user's perception and provide interactive experience.

Then based on these two types there are also MR and AV:

MR - technology which similar to AR blends the real and virtual realities and gives you the ability to interact with both simultanious without the need of various equipment besides a special AR headset like the Apple Vision or Quest 3 by Meta.

AV - system that brings real-world objects and information into a virtual environment, allowing users to interact with computer-generated elements within a virtual space.

The core motivation behind XR technologies is enhance immersion, bridge the gap between real and virtual world and create a new, more intuitive way for users to use access information and use different environmnets. Key ideas like enriching learning and training, providing innovative healthcare solutions, creating new enternainment experiences are driving the development of XR technologies.

Examples: 

- XR technologies can significantly reduce training costs for companies by providing realistic training environments through VR headsets, eliminating the need for expensive physical setups.

- Housework can become more engaging with a VR headset. Example could be vacuuming turning into coin collecting game. VR could be enhance with AI in tasks like sorting laundry, so you could more easily avoid mixing colors and ending up with pink shirts.

## XR vs Traditional Applications

Traditional desktop and mobile applications rely on 2D screens. Interactions are more limited by screen, keyboards and touch. Many tasks today rely on this type of interactions, but the sense of depth, scale, and presence is mostly missing.

XR technologies, in contrast, immerse users into 3D worlds where interactions feel real. For example, instead of clicking a button on a screen, a user can grab, move, or walk around a virtual object. This enables for types of engaging traditional computers can hardly offer.

### Advantages of XR over traditional applications:

- Greater immersion and sense of presence

- More real world like interactions

- You can walk through objects like 3D graphs and get better understanding and overall picture much easier

- Stronger engagement and better learning experience in training and education

### Disadvantages and challenges compared to traditional applications:

- Higher hardware costs and limited accessibility

- Motion sickness or fatigue present serious confort issues

- Performance and technical limitations (field of view, battery life, processing power)

- Steeper learning curve for both users and developers

## XR Use Cases and Problem-Solving
XR is applied across many fields:

- Education and training (simulating risky or costly scenarios) 

- Healthcare (surgical planning, therapy)

- Industry (maintenance guidance, prototyping)

- Entertainment (games, immersive media)

 XR enables remote collaboration, not only individual, by letting teams work together in virtual spaces as if they were together. XR’s problem-solving strength lies in making the invisible visible. Being able to turn abstract or hidden processes into tangible experiences.

## User Experience and Value
For end users, XR adds value by improving learning, engagement, and decision-making. Interactions feel more natural than traditional applications. Immersive experiences create stronger emotional connections and higher information retention. However, user comfort and accessibility must be carefully designed to avoid fatigue or alienation.

## Current vs. Future XR Technology
Today’s XR hardware offers meaningful immersion but faces trade-offs: 

- Bulky headsets 

- Limited fields of view 

- Short battery life 

- Software platforms are fragmented, and content creation remains complex. 

The future vision is lightweight, stylish devices with seamless integration of real and virtual worlds, broader accessibility, and better connectivity. The ideal XR environment is one where digital content is as natural and reliable to interact with as the physical world.
