# XDR1-AR-Project - HavenAR

This is the first out of 2 XR projects for my XDR1 course. Together with this project there will be blogposts reflecting the work and outcomes from both projects. The second project could be found [here](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-VR-Project).

## Blogposts
The blogpost are separated in 4 sections. The first section is about the 1st introduction week. The 2nd and 3rd section is about the AR and VR projects. Where the first week of both is about decisions and what lead to taking them plus some set up work. Asset references can be found there as well. The 4th section is about the personal reflection we have to give about the work on the project.
