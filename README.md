# HavenAR

HavenAR is a place were you can immerse into an environment using only your phone and headphones. During busy days we do not have a lot of time for relaxation, so we tend to burry ourself in work and burn out. With HeavenAR you could pull your phone out, put your headphones and immerse in a calm environment projected on nearby table for 5 or 10 mins. That could potentially reduce your stress, make you calm again and help you focus better on tasks at hand. 

## Use Cases
**Stressed worker:**

**Stressed student waiting for examination:**

You are a student who is infront of the examination room waiting for his turn. You are seeing all other students stressed about the exam reading through everything again and again. You have read everything and you know that you are prepared but still concerned that the examinor could ask something unexpected. You panic. Then in the panic you start scrolling through your phone. You see HeavenAR. You remembered that fellow student showed you this some months ago. You put your headphones on and start the app. You immerse into the small ocean that you put on the floor. You hear the waves splashing. You feel relaxed. Suddenly your name is said. You turn around and see the examinor asking for you with a smile. You enter the room and answer calmly the questions they ask you. They give you 12 because you were feeling calm and confident in what you know.
