# XDR1-AR-Project - HavenAR

This is the 1st out of 2 XR projects for my XDR1 course. Together with this project there will be blogposts reflecting the work and outcomes from both projects. The 2nd project can be found [here](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-VR-Project).The blogposts can be found also below.

## Blogposts
The blogpost are separated in 4 sections. 

Week [1](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week1_introduction.md) is about the 1st introduction week. 

Week [4](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week4_lab1.md) and [9](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week9_lab4.md) are about decisions and what lead to taking them plus some set up work. Asset references can be found there as well. 

Week [5](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week5_lab2.md), [6](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week6_lab3.md), [10](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week10_lab5.md), [11](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week11_lab6.md) are about the AR and VR projects. 

The 4th section is about the personal reflection we have to give about the work on the projects.
